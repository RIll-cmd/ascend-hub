# Ascend roadmap — Hub and Vision

Updated 2026-10-14.

**Goals:**
- **Hub:** the owner's main coding tool, where Codex, Claude and Antigravity plan, build and review together.
- **Vision:** a light AI assistant that tells the owner when the agents are done or need a reply, and lets the owner answer by voice.

## Where things stand

**Hub:**
- The Agent Room covers discuss → roles → plan → build → review → finish, with three owner gates. It also has debate mode, sub-agent visibility, the 3D deck and sound.
- The status shelf shows Codex CLI, Antigravity CLI, Core and Vision.
- The one-click launcher starts Hub in production mode, about 150 MB.
- **Gaps:**
  - the Room only builds new projects in `D:\ascend-builds`;
  - a waiting gate is visible only on the Room page;
  - a gate can only be approved or rejected, not sent back with changes.

**Vision:**
- Camera focus coaching, voice commands (faster-whisper), Kokoro speech and the Fairy UI.
- A read-only `hub_status` tool and an Agent needs input option that is disabled by default.
- Idle CPU went from 7.5 to 2 cores on 2026-10-14.
- **Gaps:**
  - about 1.1 GB of memory even when only the assistant is wanted;
  - no awareness of the Agent Room.

## Milestones

| # | Milestone | What it gives the owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Room attention and change requests | Each waiting gate carries a plain summary and 2–4 suggested changes. Roles and plan gates accept "revise" with a note, so the agents redo that step. The Hub gate bar offers the options. | Done (2026-10-14) |
| M2 | Vision agent announcer with voice gates | Vision says when the agents finish or need a reply. It reads the gate summary and takes "approve", "change" (lists the options or takes dictation, then confirms) or "reject" by voice. | Done (2026-10-14) |
| M3 | Workflow view | A timeline graph of the session: stages, task nodes with agent, time, diff and test results, and a loop view counting coder ↔ reviewer rounds. | Next |
| M4 | Room on real repositories | Each session works in a git worktree and branch of an existing repo. Tests, lint and build run after every task, a red result blocks "done", and the finish gate shows the diff, then merges or opens a PR. | Planned |
| M5 | Light Vision | An Assistant mode that never loads the camera models (YOLO, MediaPipe, torch), with an optional int8 Kokoro voice. Target under 500 MB. | Planned |
| M6 | Harness extras | Session templates (feature, bug fix, refactor, debate); per-role model choice; time and token budgets; parallel tasks in worktrees with a merge queue; a quota meter; decision memory per project. | Later |

**Reliability work alongside:**
- Room sessions keep a pending gate across restarts.
- The launcher restarts a crashed app and says why.
- One tray for both apps.
- One shared local token for Vision → Hub calls.

## M1 — Room attention and change requests (Hub)

- `scripts/agent-room/attention.mjs` builds `attention` for the session view from the session state. It returns `null` when the owner isn't needed.
  - **Gate:** `{ kind: 'gate', gate, summary, options, decisions }`.
    - The roles summary names who orchestrates, codes and reviews.
    - The plan summary lists the tasks and their assignees.
    - The result summary is the opening of the orchestrator's final summary.
  - **Pause:** `{ kind: 'pause', summary, options: [], decisions: ['retry', 'stop'] }`.
- The roles and plan JSON may carry `options`: 2–4 short alternative changes, each at most 160 characters. The prompts ask for them, the validators keep them, and they're shown at the gate.
- The roles and plan gates accept `decision: 'revise'` with `note` (1–2000 characters).
  - The Room records "Owner asked for changes: …" in the transcript and sends the session back to the `roles` or `plan` step. The agents see the note in the conversation.
  - The result gate stays accept/reject.
- The Hub gate bar shows the suggested changes as buttons, plus a free-text field and a **Request changes** button.

## M2 — Vision agent announcer and voice gates

- `integrations/agent_room.py` reads `GET http://127.0.0.1:5173/api/room/sessions/current` and posts `/api/room/sessions/current/gate`, with short timeouts. Hub refuses any non-loopback host.
- `assistant/room_dialog.py`, a pure state machine:
  - **New gate:** "The agents need you: <summary>. Say approve, change, or reject."
  - **Session finished:** "Codex, Claude and Antigravity are done." It also announces stopped and paused sessions.
  - **Approve or reject:** asks for a yes before sending.
  - **Change:** lists "Option 1: … Option 2: …" or takes "change: <words>", then confirms ("Send option 2 to the room? Say yes.") before sending `revise` with that note.
  - **Cancel:** "never mind" drops the dialog. A gate that closes elsewhere ends the dialog.
- `main.py` runs a watcher thread every 3 seconds when `agent_room.enabled` is on (the default; a missing Hub just means silence). The dialog gets first look at unmatched speech while it's active.
- Every decision is written to the Room transcript by Hub, so the Hub page shows what Vision sent.
